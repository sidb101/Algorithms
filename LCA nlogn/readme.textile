Problem -
=======
Given a Tree (AdjList) and Q queries each having pair (u, v). Find the 
LCA for each pair of nodes, assuming both u & v exist in Tree

INPUT -
=====
n
(for node=1) number_of_adj_nodes [list of adj nodes]
(for node=2) number_of_adj_nodes [list of adj nodes]
..
(for node=n) number_of_adj_nodes [list of adj nodes]
q
u1 v1
..
uq vq

Solution -
========
O(n) Preprocessing with O(logn) queries, modelling the LCA problem as 
RMQ problem by traversing Euler Tour
